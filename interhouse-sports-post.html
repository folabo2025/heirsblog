                    The whistles are blowing, the tracks are being lined, and the air at Heirs of Promise Schools is thick with the spirit of healthy rivalry. Our much-anticipated 2026 Inter-House Sports competition is fast approaching, and this year promises to be our most spectacular edition yet.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At HOPS, we believe that the field of play is as much a classroom as the laboratory. It is on this field that our students learn the invaluable lessons of teamwork, discipline, resilience, and the grace to be both a humble winner and a gallant loser.
                </p>

                <h3>Four Houses, One Goal</h3>
                <p>
                    Preparation has reached a fever pitch across all four houses: <strong>Blue (Integrity)</strong>, <strong>Red (Valor)</strong>, <strong>Green (Excellence)</strong>, and <strong>Yellow (Wisdom)</strong>. While our sprinters are perfecting their relay baton exchanges, our chess and scrabble teams are sharpening their tactical minds for the indoor categories.
                </p>

                <h3>New Features for 2026</h3>
                <p>
                    This year, we are proud to introduce the <strong>Parent-Staff Relay Race</strong> and the <strong>Junior Martial Arts Exhibition</strong>. These additions reflect our commitment to a holistic community where parents, staff, and students celebrate physical fitness together.

                    <p>To ensure every child receives their customized sports kit (Jersey, Shorts, and House Cap) and to facilitate the logistics of the event, we kindly remind all parents and guardians to complete the <strong>Inter-House Sports Fee</strong> payment.</p>
                    <p><strong>Deadline for Payment:</strong> Friday, February 27th, 2026.</p>

                <h3>The Grand Finale</h3>
                <p>
                    The grand finale will take place at the Main Stadium, featuring a colorful March Past and the final medal presentations. We invite all parents to come out in their house colors to cheer on their wards as they push their physical limits and build memories that will last a lifetime.
                </p>
